Shift-click to place a flag (which just turns the cell red).\r\n\r\nI was working on another game project, got stuck, and really needed to feel like I was making progress on something. So this was born in a few hours one afternoon.\r\n\r\nThere's probably some questionable code in here and there are definitely many unimplemented things. Both of those are to be expected given how long I didn't work on it.\r\n\r\nIt's here on Github in case I ever decide to flesh it out a little more.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

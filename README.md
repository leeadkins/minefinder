# Mine Finder

Mine Finder is a very, very basic minesweeper clone.

It only supports a 16x16 grid with 20 mines.

To reveal a square, click it. Shift-click to place a flag (which just turns the cell red).

I was working on another game project, got stuck, and really needed to feel like I was making progress on something. So this was born in a few hours one afternoon.

There's probably some questionable code in here and there are definitely many unimplemented things. Both of those are to be expected given how long I didn't work on it.

It's here on Github in case I ever decide to flesh it out a little more.
